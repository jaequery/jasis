# Ruby Starter Framework

Jasis is an eloquent Ruby framework, that provides you a nice boilerplate code to get you started developing websites as quickly as possible.
It was inspired heavily by Padrino, but it takes it a notch further in terms of simplification by keeping Sinatra to it's core as much as possible. You won't see any Jasis library here, it will be just several Ruby gems put together on top of the Sinatra framework.

### What is Jasis?

1. 100% Docker-based for easy setup and deployment
2. Explicit by design, no more black magic, know how everything gets loaded
3. Minimal to the core (less files, less codes)
4. Stupidly simple (no crazy class hierchy, just plain simple approach)
5. Faster and lighter, up to 30% ~ 40% faster than Rails

### Setup

Jasis is developed to work within the following requirements:
- docker and docker-compose
- jwilder/nginx-proxy Docker image running listening on port 80
- dnsmasq w/ .docker extensions mapped to your docker machine's ip address

Having this allows you to virtual host any sites through Docker with a .docker domain extension (ie; http://jasis.docker). This means no more fiddling with port numbers and updating your hosts file to point to them.

Therefore, I recommend the following.

For OSX:

- install Dinghy, this will setup everything for you to run the most Docker environment on your OSX (https://github.com/codekitchen/dinghy)

For Ubuntu:

- install docker and docker-compose
- dory (https://github.com/FreedomBen/dory)


### Install
1) git clone https://github.com/jaequery/jasis
2) cd jasis
3) docker-compose up -d
4) your site should now show up on http://jasis.docker (update VIRTUAL_HOST from docker-compose.yml)

#### dotenv for dev / production environment variables
To set environmental variables depending on your environment, we used dotenv. You simply place a .env file at the root of the app folder.

.env (base)
.env.development
.env.production

Within it, you can simply have:

```
TWITTER_KEY=xxxxx
TWITTER_SECRET=xxxxx
```

And you would call it from your app using:

```
ENV['TWITTER_KEY']
```

#### Send Emails

1. Configure your SMTP settings from the .env file
2. Call the email() helper function within the controllers

Standard Email
```
email({:from => 'me@email.com', :to => 'user@email.com', :subject => 'hi', :body => 'Hello'})
```

Email through a liquid file
```
email({:to => 'user@email.com', :subject => 'hi'}, {:file => "emails/welcome.liquid", :data => {'name' => 'john'} })
```
